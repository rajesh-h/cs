          <p><strong>What Inspired Me to Cook!</strong></p>
          <p>
            What can inspire a 12 year old to suddenly jog in to kitchen, grab
            the ingredients and make out some awesomely delicious dish.

          <p>
            Ok, it sounds so weird to praise one self. Let me narrate you my
            story to kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was almost 3 years back, when I introduced myself to watch
            videos online and text recipes.. It was just a start for a foodie to
            see others cook.. In a few hours itself, I was like i cant even miss
            a single recipe..<br />I wanted to see all the recipes.. I used to
            sit and watch people to cook.. People who cook in a
            roadside&nbsp;stall to a 7 star restaurant..<br />Family members and
            guests who saw me using laptop for hours used to
            say,&nbsp;&rdquo;Dont play so much games. Its not good for your
            eyes&rdquo;. I dint care..
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a long time since i was watching others, I thought to give a
            try to a recipe. And, then made&nbsp;<a

              >Butter Paneer Masala</a
            >(my first dish). Believe it or not, I got compliments like it is
            the most &ldquo;five stariest&rdquo; dish, and so on by my family
            and relatives who visit seldom to our place.
          </p>
          <p>It went on this way for 2 years.</p>
          <p>
            Last month, I had thought for an experiment. why not try to YouTube
            my stuff? If I can have the guts to do so?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is all what happened, hope I fulfil my dream to try out every
            single &ldquo;vegetarian&rdquo; recipe in the most classic
            professional way.
